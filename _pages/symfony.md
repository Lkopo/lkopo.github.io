Symfony is one of the most famous PHP frameworks with huge community and it's growing fast -- really fast. Some may know that Symfony framework has so many files for sometimes so little project, like [Symfony demo](https://github.com/symfony/demo). But is it hard to learn it? Back in the days PHP frameworks were not as popular as of today and so was the challenge to learn it. Documentation was poor, beginners were stucked at the beginning and lack of community was a reason to stick with "traditional" development of pages in PHP -- fast development with low modularity and high cost in case of change during development process.

So back to the question whether is it hard to learn such huge framework as Symfony. No :). In the following exercises, you will see that the development in current frameworks is really simple and makes you focus only on one thing -- application. You no longer need to bother with development of fundamental things which will be the core before you can actually start developing the application.
